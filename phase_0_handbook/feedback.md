# Feedback

###Submitting Feedback

You must complete feedback on [Feedbackinator](https://socrates.devbootcamp.com/feedback/new) for every pairing session (GPS and Peer Pairing) you complete to receive credit for it. If you do not submit feedback for your pair, we will not know you have done the pairing session, and you may be flagged for not meeting Phase 0 expectations. 

**Make sure you watch [Engineering Empathy: EQ and Feedback prior to giving feedback](http://vimeo.com/76762772).**

#### All feedback must be anonymous to protect privacy.** 
Abstain from writing your pair's name anywhere in the free-form text to protect their privacy. Other students review each piece of feedback and rate it for kindness, actionability, and specificity.  

Feedback will not reach a student if it is not rated high enough on each of these measures by other students. This means that all feedback is viewed by many students, and it's important to make receiving feedback a safe and positive experience. 

Writing good feedback is challenging and time consuming. In the past, students have noted the feedback they received in unit one helped them, but feedback gradually became less specific and actionable. Be generous with your time and make sure to write feedback that will help your pair grow as a partner and as a programmer. 

**Please Note: Feedback is not editable in Socrates once it's submitted, and you can't see who you submitted feedback for. Please keep this in mind as you give feedback for others.** 


### Meta Feedback

To rate feedback go to [Feedbackinator - Feedback Dashboard](https://socrates.devbootcamp.com/feedback)

In order to make sure you and your pairs receive the feedback you've each submitted, **all students are required to rate at least 20 pieces of feedback per unit.** 

Unfortunately, there is no counter in Socrates for you to keep track of the amount you rate, so it is up to you to find a way to keep track of how many pieces you've rated. You will be expected to keep track of how much feedback you rate and enter it on your weekly submission form.
