# Frequently Asked Questions
This will be updated as you ask questions on the google+ community. 

**Q: Are Introductory Sessions on Skype or Google?**<br>
**A:** From this point, all of our sessions will be conducted via google hangout. If you signed up properly, you should have an event on your google calendar with a link to join the video call. Join the call at the appropriate times. Follow [these instructions](intro_gps_signup.md) to sign up. 

**Q: How do I change my DBC email address?** <br>
**A:** Unfortunately this isn't very simple at this point since we use multiple systems. You should first change your email address on [Dev Bootcamp's Application Website](http://apply.devbootcamp.com/) and then contact the [facilitator](contact_and_support_list.md) with the following template to change your address: 

  Please include (just copy paste and fill in):
  
  1. Name:
  2. Cohort and location:
  3. Old email address:
  4. New email address:
  5. Do you want your email changed in Socrates as well? 

**Q: Can we use DBC space in Phase 0?** <br>
**A:** In order to maintain an optimal learning environment for students in phases 1-3, phase 0 students are not permitted to study in DBC sites prior to starting phase 1. Phase 0 students may, however, attend DBCx meetups ( [CHI](http://www.meetup.com/Chicago-DevBootcamp-Speaker-Series/), [NYC](http://www.meetup.com/DBCx-NYC/), [SF](http://www.meetup.com/DBCx-SF-Dev-Bootcamp-San-Francisco-Open-Learning/)) in the space during events or ask to tour the space. Please email the [facilitator](contact_and_support_list.md) to begin the process of arranging a tour.

**Q: What are the hours at DBC?** <br>
**A:** This depends on the location. Ask the [facilitator](contact_and_support_list.md) in the introductory session.

**Q: I'm trying to add the office hour and cohort google calendar to my calendar, and it says I don't have access. What do I do?**<br>
**A:** There are a few reasons this could happen, but it's almost always a permissions issue. As you can imagine, we don't want just ANYONE able to add themselves to
sessions, so we only allow certain people viewing and editing access. We do this through google groups. 

What email address are you receiving our communications from? If it is different from your google calendar account, you'll need to submit an email address change request (shown above). 

If you have two separate google accounts, make sure you are signing up under the one we sent the invite to. If you want to change it, please submit and email address change request. 

**Q: I didn't receive a google calendar invite. How can I get access to the necessary calendars?**<br>
**A:** Because we use google groups to maintain permissions (far easier than inviting everyone separately), you won't always receive an email. But if your address is correct in the google group, you automatically have access. Go to the google+ community and find the two calendar links under "About this community." You can then add them.
