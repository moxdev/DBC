# How to Review Other's Solutions

We use a github feature "issues" to give feedback to other students. The instructions for doing this are below. 


### Make sure your repo's "Issues" are enabled
For each Phase 0 Repository, you will need to have issues enabled to be able to get feedback. 

Please do this for each repo you have. Click on **settings** on the "Features" section, add a check next to "Issues." This will allow others to give you feedback on your site!

### How to find other solutions
Take a look at some other students' solutions to the challenges. To do this, go to the fork icon at the top of your repo. Thereshould be a number next to it. Click on the number. It will take you to a graph. Above the graph, click on the "members" tab, which will take you to all of the forks. You should be able to see all of them since you are all in a team together.

You can also collect your other accountability members usernames and find it simply by substituting Devbootcamp with their username, which will take you to that person's fork.

### Who to Review
Review one of your accountability group members' solutions and another student who is not in your accountability group. Give them actionable, specific, and kind (ASK) feedback. If they do not have issues enabled, please let them know and remind them to do so. 

### How to create a new issue
1. Click on "Issues"
2. Click on "New Issue"
3. Write your feedback (with a title) using Markdown. You can preview your markdown by clicking on the "Preview" tab.
4. When you finish, click "Submit new issue"

### Feedback
Practice writing kind, actionable, specific feedback to other students. 

Here are some sample questions to use:
- If you were going to implement the pseudocode, would it be easy to follow?
- Proper Variable Naming - make the variable name descriptive and concise  
  * Avoid naming variables after the data structure (array, string, arr, hash, hsh, etc) 
  * Avoid numbered variables (var1, var2, var3)  
  * Avoid single character names (i, x, n)
- Proper Method Naming  
  *The name should reflect the method's single responsibility 
- Keep it DRY  
  * Condense repetitive code  
  * Create new methods to encapsulate common functions   
- Did you like the logic?
- Was every variable necessary) 
- What did the student do well?
- What could they have done better?
- How was their reflection? 
- Did you learn anything from this solution?
