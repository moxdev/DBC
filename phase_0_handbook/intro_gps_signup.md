# How to Sign Up for Intro Sessions and GPS

We are using google calendars to sign up for introductory sessions and GPSs. It's a bit of a learning curve
at first, but bear with us.

### Calendar Links
You may receive an email from maria@devbootcamp.com saying a calendar was shared with you. NOTE: It's only
shared with the email address the invite was sent to. If that is not a google account, or you use a different
calendar (with a different email), please email us according to the instructions below. If you do not receive an email, please look on your google+ community under "About this community." The links are located there as well.. 

You can also follow this [video](http://vimeo.com/92005818) on how to sign up.

When you receive that email, add both calendars to your account.

### Here are the steps to sign up:
1. Click on a session you want
2. Check the number of guests listed under guests. If there are 3 for a GPS or 6 for an intro session, the session is full.
3. If the session is not full, please add your email address under "guests" and change the remaining number of spots.
If the session is full change the [1 left] to [FULL]. Make sure you save the changes! Then click the button that does not send invites to existing guests. Please do not click the "X" on this modal. It may not save the session properly.
4. When you add your email to the session, you will also have the same session appear on your personal 
gmail calendar. So if everything was done properly, you should see two sessions side by side.
5. **DOUBLE CHECK** your email is added to the master session and that your personal copy looks the exact same (has a video call and guests). If there are any discrepancies between the master and your own, something probably messed up somewhere. Try again. 

When the time for your GPS arrives, click the "Join Video Call" link in the invite.

If you have any issues getting into the session, please contact the session creator (listed in the event). They will be able to help you.

If you have any questions, problems, or concerns, please contact us.

#### To Cancel a GPS Session
**You must cancel at least 6 hours in advance!** 
- Go to the **master calendar** and click the 'x' next to your email address, change the number of spots left in the title -- then **SAVE**. 
- **DO NOT USE the RSVP to cancel** - That is the event on your personal calendar and will not remove you from the session.
- It goes without saying that you should be very careful not to delete anyone else's name or sessions from the master calendar. 

## How to change your email address:
Please send <mailto:kelly@devbootcamp.com> an email with the subject "Change email address"
Please include (just copy paste and fill in):

1. Name:
2. Cohort and location:
3. Old email address:
4. New email address:
5. Do you want your email changed in Socrates as well?

This will change where we email updates and calendar permissions.
