# Office Hours

Phase 0 provides at least 10 office hours per week. These are times where an Prep Guide will enter the [collaboration hangout](https://plus.google.com/hangouts/_/event/cn84s0i6f761j9rpv4a3ljddg0o?authuser=0&hl=en) to answer any of your questions. 

You do not need to sign up for office hours, just jump into the hangout and ask your questions anytime during that hour. You don't need to stay the whole time. 

Please note: Office hours are times to get help with concepts in the Phase 0 curriculum. We know that many of you take some extra time to work on other projects you want help on, but advanced questions from these projects should wait for DBC on site. 

*If the guide who created the session is not there, please email them (as well as <mailto:phase0@devbootcamp.com>).*

Please use office hours for getting help with github. Prep guides can help debug your issues with github and it's far easier to do that in a video call as opposed to email.
